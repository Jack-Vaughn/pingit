# pingit for Mac OS

# This was written in Swift 1 back when it was just called Swift. It needs to be completely written in a newer version of Swift in order to run on newer machines.

This was designed as an in-house help desk application, to get alerts when a specific machine came online and a easy way to one click screenshare into the computer.

This application runs completely in the menu bar. Simply copy the IP/name of the machine in question, click on the transparent cloud and pingit. The cloud remains transparent until the machien comes online, then it turns white and triggers a Mac OS notifications.
